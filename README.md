# MedASR

MedASR is an automated speech recognition (ASR) model that takes spoken audio as an input and represents it as text. MedASR has been specifically trained for the healthcare domain. This means it has higher out-of-the box performance in healthcare contexts than general ASR models. MedASR is open and can be fine-tuned for even higher performance.
